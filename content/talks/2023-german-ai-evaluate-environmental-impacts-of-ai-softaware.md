In a webinar for the [German AI Association](https://ki-verband.de/en/), [Benoit Petit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bepetit/) and I presented our work on [SoftAWERE](https://knowledge.sdialliance.org/softawere) a project to evaluate the environmental impacts in GitLAB CI/CD pipelines. In this talked we focused on an AI use case. This project is supported by the [SDIA](https://sdialliance.org/), [Boavizta](https://boavizta.org/en/), [Helio](https://helio.exchange/) and [Hubblo](https://hubblo.org/).
