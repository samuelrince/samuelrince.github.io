I presented the state of Green AI and [GenAI Impact](https://genai-impact.org/) methodology and tool [EcoLogits](https://ecologits.ai/) to assess the environmental footprint of generative AI. This event was organized by the [Compar:IA](https://www.comparia.beta.gouv.fr/) team in collaboration with the [French Ministry of Culture](https://www.culture.gouv.fr/) and [beta.gouv.fr](https://beta.gouv.fr/) for the 2025 [AI Action Summit](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia) in France.
