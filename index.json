Big tech companies are pushing Generative AI to the extent that it delays their environmental impact reduction targets.\nIn this webinar, we will explore various aspects of AI\u0026rsquo;s environmental impacts. We will discuss the contributions of non-profits including Boavizta, CodeCarbon and GenAI Impact focusing on methodologies and tools that simplify assessing these impacts. We will also address what sets GenAI models apart in terms of their environmental footprint compared to ‚Äúnon-generative‚Äù or ‚Äútraditional‚Äù AI models. We will highlight the risks and discuss how new regulations such as the CSRD or the AI Act will affect organizations that integrate AI into their workflows and services. Additionally, we will provide recommendations on how to address and mitigate these risks, with a particular focus on reducing impacts.\nSamuel Rinc√© will be our speaker, sharing his expertise in the field of Green AI. Currently working as the Lead AI Architect at Alygne, he has spent recent years working on Natural Language Processing technologies. Also, as the president and co-founder of GenAI Impact and an active participant in Boavizta‚Äôs working groups, he will share the latest progress and innovations made by these non-profit organizations.\n","date":"23 October 2024","permalink":"/talks/2024-isit-be-planet-tech-care-green-ai-webinar/","section":"Talks","summary":"\u003cp\u003eArtificial Intelligence has a significant environmental footprint, and its development and adoption by both the public and organizations continue to expand steadily.

We introduce our open-source tool, EcoLogits, implemented in Python, which assesses the environmental footprint of GenAI services at each request, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral AI, and many others.\nFinally, we provide best practices on how to reduce the environmental footprint of AI and IT in organizations. These include practicing frugal AI, questioning the necessity of AI and GenAI implementations, and offering tips on how to reduce the number of new devices in an organization.\n","date":"19 September 2024","permalink":"/talks/2024-adira-genai-impact-with-ecologits/","section":"Talks","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this talk for the \u003ca href=\"https://www.adira.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003eADIRA\u003c/a\u003e, we explore the environmental impacts of generative AI.
